### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Barry and I am an agile-ist, web developer, technology generalist, and Scrum Master. I love mentoring others, helping to make work-life better for teams, leaving things in a better state than I found them. I have co-presented talks, with [Allison Polard](http://www.allisonpollard.com/), at Agile 2018, Agile 2019, and regional agile gatherings. Barry is also an award-winning home brewer and an avid amateur photographer.
